# AWS-SageMaker-MLOPs
End-to-end machine learning (ML) workflows (MLOPs) using Amazon SageMaker Pipelines, Amazon SageMaker Model Registry, and Amazon SageMaker Clarify.

In this tutorial, you will implement a SageMaker pipeline to build, train, and deploy an XGBoost binary classification model that predicts the likelihood of an auto insurance claim being fraudulent. You will use a synthetically generated auto insurance claims dataset. The raw inputs are two tables of insurance data: a claims table and a customers table. The claims table has a column named fraud indicating whether a claim was fraudulent or otherwise. Your pipeline will process the raw data; create training, validation, and test datasets; and build and evaluate a binary classification model. It will then use SageMaker Clarify to test model bias and explainability, and lastly deploy the model for inference.
